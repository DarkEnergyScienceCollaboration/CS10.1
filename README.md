#  Identify relevant galaxy properties

Summary -- Deliver a set of simulations for large volume studies

## Key Tasks
* Key Task CS10.1.1 ( 12/18 ): Carry out simulations
* Key Task CS10.1.2 ( 12/18 ): Analyze simulations

### Suggested organization
Repositories are available per deliverable.  Each key task has a subdirectory.
We have a `source` directory in each key task area for any supporting
code that goes with an effort.  There will also be a `doc` directory to hold documents in markdown,
latex, or binary formats.  The idea is to version everything and give us a good way to diff things.

Each deliverable is slightly different, so these repositories should grow to support the different need.

Please feel free to use github issues on each repository to organize work.
